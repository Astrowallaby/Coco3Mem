# Coco3Mem

This is a collection of open-access schematics for memory expansion
boards for the Tandy Color Computer 3. The intention is to document
several variations of these boards, suitable for construction by users
with different levels of soldering skill and available tools. (IE,
there will be a variant using all through-hole parts, etc.)

At some point plans for an accessory memory mapper to enable 2MB (or
more?) of RAM might also find their way in here.
